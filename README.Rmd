`mutant` - mutation testing

(wikipedia: [mutation testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing) vs. [fuzzing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing))

## info

- mutaters: in `mutaters.R`
  - currently only have: 
    - boolean replacement (TRUE -> FALSE, and vice versa)
    - binary operator replacement (e.g., > to >=)

## install

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ropenscilabs/astr", "roepnsci/mutant")
```

## current workflow

As of this writing (2020-05-18) ...

```{r eval=FALSE}
# path to an R package with working tests in tests/
path <- "../randgeo/" 
## collect fxns into an environment
env <- collect_fxns(path)
ls.str(env)
## make pkg map for later
pkgmap <- make_pkg_map(path)
## parse fxns with getParseData
# fxns <- parse_fxns(env)
## mutate something
mut_fxns <- mutate(as.list(env))
# what fxn was mutated?
which(vapply(mut_fxns, function(x) attr(x, "mutated"), logical(1)))
## write a new package with test suite to a tempdir
new_fxns <- make_fxns(mut_fxns)
newpath <- write_mutated_pkg(pkg_path = path, fxns = new_fxns, map = pkgmap)
## run test suite & collect diagnostics
mutout <- mutation_test(newpath)
# mutout
dplyr::select(data.frame(mutout), file, context, test, nb, failed, skipped, error, warning, passed)
```

This will all be internal code however - only exposing probably a few functions to users to 
run mutation testing, do something with results, etc.

## To do

brainstorming high level steps:

1. map input package api
  - optionally map what test lines are linked to what code lines ([#10](https://github.com/ropensci/mutant/issues/10))
2. generate mutants
  - each of these are full packages, which with a different mutation
3. put all mutants in a queue ([#2](https://github.com/ropensci/mutant/issues/2))
4. test all mutants - pull jobs from the queue until all are done
5. collate results, write to disk
